# invertsquared

This is a python3.8 project that is being made for CIS4930: Performant Programming in Python.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-    
An up and coming puzzle game that is simple and concept but difficult to solve! Try to replicate the image that is shown to you by touching the tiles on the grid; however there is a twist. When a tile is touched, the surrounding tiles (minus the ones in the diagonal directions) are also flipped! Try to figure out the best set of moves to solve the puzzle.

AESTHETICS:
Color scheme and gameplay layout:
Muted colors, flat design; minimalist

![Art Inspiration (Not Invert Squared)_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55326415/94352158-8c2aa500-002f-11eb-957b-bd67b099dbf2.png)

- Image to be replicated in top right corner; rounded edges for softer, embedded look
- Game grid will be variants of an N x N grid of tiles, such as 3x3, 5x5, etc.

SCREENS:
- Home screen: logo in the center (letters are colored, bg is grey); beneath logo: settings/menu, play, share icons;
- Settings screen: game mode (dark/light) (maybe?? or we just stick with the dark theme); audio/vibration settings (if applicable); credits
- Pause screen: home button; settings button; restart level button; select level button;
- Share screen: copy app link for play store; share to Twitter, FB, etc.;
- Level selection screen: 1. choose between Classic, Challenge, Expert (horizontal bars, rounded edges in the center of screen); 2. Select level (level mode will be at top centered; levels will be sorted by difficult ie. lvl 1 is easiest, 20 is hardest; levels display will show the image to replicate); back button in upper left corner;

GAMEPLAY:
- 10/20 levels each mode (maybe 20 for Classic/Challenge, 10 for Expert)
  - 3 Difficulty Modes: Classic, Challenge, Expert
- Classic Mode: image to be replicated in upper right corner; playing with no time limits or move limits; STRATEGY-BASED gameplay
- Challenge Mode: image to be replicated in upper right corner; playing within a given amount of moves; STRATEGY-BASED gameplay
- Expert Mode: image will be shown before you begin the level, but will not remain on screen; MEMORY-BASED gameplay; NO HINTS ALLOWED
